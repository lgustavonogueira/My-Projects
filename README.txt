This document describes, in general terms, the proposal for the development of a software called SDCV - Service Desk Cappavilla Village, which will provide a platform for interaction among residents of Cappavilla Village and its employees and officials.
Every day dozens of residents need to go to the reception to report problems in their apartments or common areas, so disrupts the work of employees who need to hear and record the complaint of a resident, and then initiate a corrective measure. The focus of SDCV is to make the system receives a complaint or suggestion of a resident, assess which category it fits, and then routes it to the correct administrative sector.
Employees of the village earn time to accomplish the tasks of day-to-day; residents dont need to leave their homes to report irregularities; and the language barrier causes less impact and chances of misinterpretation, since most villagers are international students, who do not always speak English, especially in the beginning of your stay, a time that most problems are reported.
